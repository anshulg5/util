 * Basic abstraction for the builder pattern.  A builder can have elements
 * added to it, and once some number of elements have been added, can use those
 * elements to construct an object of some sort.

 * Builders are meant to be used once to create an object and then thrown
 * away, not reused.
 * <p/>
 * This class is parameterized on (typically) its own type so that, if additional
 * methods are required (for example, URLBuilder lets you set some things and
 * add others), the exact builder subclass does not need to be exposed.
