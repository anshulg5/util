    <h1>List-like Abstractions</h1>
    <p>
        This package includes interfaces which make up the minimal decomposition
        of the concept of a list, which are frequently more powerful and less
        clunky in isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>java.util.List</code> rolls together a bunch of heterogenous
        abstractions which are more powerful when separated:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code><a href="IntAddressable.html">IntAddressable</a></code> &mdash; 
            the ability to provide an
            object for a given index</li>
        <li><code><a href="IntResolvable.html">IntResolvable</a></code> &mdash; 
            the ability to get the index of
            an object</li>
        <li><code><a href="IntAddressable.html">IntSized</a></code> &mdash; 
            thing that has a size that can be
            represented as an integer</li>
        <li><code><a href="Indexed.html">Indexed</a></code> &mdash; 
            thing with an integer size which has
            the ability to provide an object for a given index</li>
        <li><code><a href="IndexedResolvable.html">IndexedResolvable</a></code> &mdash; 
            thing with an integer size which has
            the ability to provide an object for a given index and can also 
            map objects to their indices.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Frequently one needs to implement an algorithm which needs some, but
        not all, of these abstractions, and that algorithm will be more flexible
        if it does <i>not</i> need anything it is applied to to already be in
        a <code>List</code> or be copied into one.  For example, binary search
        requires a size and the ability to fetch items from a list, but does
        not need any other methods of <code>List</code>, and may be applied
        to data structures so large that copying them into a list is prohibitive - 
        yet both implementations of binary search in the JDK require an array
        or a <code>List</code>.  So unpacking these abstractions and providing
        simple ways to wrap collections in them allows implementations of things
        that operate on them to be far more powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar classes are provided for long-indexed data, which can be used
        over files or large data stores.
